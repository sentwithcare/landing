      <p>Dear Reader,</p>
      <p>👫 These days our world moves so fast, sometimes keeping family and friends up&#x2011;to&#x2011;date with your life is&nbsp;hard.</p>

      <p>💬 Social media is good for sharing snapshots of our lives, but don’t let you tell the full story. And email leaves a lot to be&nbsp;desired.</p>
      <p>🙇‍ The art of writing a letter has been lost. Which is a shame because the process helps to gather your thoughts.</p>

    <p>✍️ Craft a thoughtful letter and choose the people you want to receive&nbsp;it.</p>
    <%= image_tag 'reader.svg', :class => "dotted" %>
    <p>💌 A person you care about gets a text and &mdash; when they have a moment clear of distractions &mdash; they follow a link to what you have written.</p>
    <p>😊 They smile at your message and hey, as it happens, they are going to be in Cornwall in July too “Let’s meet up!”</p>
